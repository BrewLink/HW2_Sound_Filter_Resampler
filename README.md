# HW2_Sound_Filter_Resampler
# CS510 - HW2 -  4/10/22

#### MacOS Build:
                  Includes a make file
                  Instructions - in terminal type:
                    make
                    halfrate ./sine.wav 
                    
                  Test script also generate the files
                    sh btest.sh

#### Linux Build:
                  Haven't had the time to try
                  but seems like it should be very straight forward givent the macs makefile

#### Win Build:
                  Unknown
                  
                 
                 
#### Summary:
##### For this homework, reading the wavfile was very smooth. However, I frist built a resmapler in HW, then built a filter in there. I then moved those functions into a new project which I read the wavfile. Most things were smooth. I haven't had time to optimize my code further more but it's already much faster than what was mentioned about python of this HW. I also haven't had time to look into cmake or try this on Linux. For now xcode and Makefile is where this homework iscompatilbe. However, I did have the chance to look into learning more about bash scripting to autoamte some of the redundant related tassks while working on homework.
